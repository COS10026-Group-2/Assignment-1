    <i class="figma"> <h2> Figma Design Unification </h2> </i> 
        <p> We leveraged Figma to create a centralized 
            design system for all HTML pages. This involved establishing 
            consistent color palettes, typography styles, spacing guidelines, 
            and component libraries. By providing a single source of truth for visual 
            elements, Figma enabled all team members to quickly grasp the intended look
             and feel of the website. This streamlined development, reduced miscommunication, 
             and ensured a cohesive user experience across all pages, as everyone had clear 
             visual references to follow.</p>
    <i class="Shadow"><h2> Section Shadow Differentiation </h2> </i>
        <p> To improve visual hierarchy and distinguish 
            between different content sections on the webpage, 
            we implemented subtle box shadows for each container. 
            This design choice added depth to the layout, making it 
            easier for users to visually parse information. 
            The shadows created clear boundaries between sections 
            without being overly intrusive, enhancing readability 
            and overall aesthetic appeal. This simple yet effective
             technique contributed to a more organized and professional 
             appearance of the website. </p>
    <i class="Animations"> <h2> CSS Animation for Navigation </h2> </i> 
        <p> In the jobs.html page, we incorporated CSS ease-in and ease-out animations 
            for each section. When users scroll or navigate between sections, 
            these animations provide smooth transitions, giving a sense of 
            fluidity and polish to the user experience. 
            The subtle animations help users visually track their movement through the page, making it easier to understand the structure and find specific job listings. 
            This thoughtful addition of motion enhances engagement and makes the browsing experience more intuitive and enjoyable.
